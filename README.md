# What's `jekyll-boom-theme`?

It's a jekyll starter theme for books using boom! - a microformat for books.


## What's Boom!

Boom! is a microformat - a series of conventions and best practices - first published in

> directly from HTML and CSS files. In this article we sketch our solution and quote from the style sheet used. Towards the end we
> describe the book microformat (boom!) we developed in the process.
